<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
	The main focus of this workshop is to favor new collaborations by getting to know each other
	while working together on a common problem.
	It is somehow frustrating to spend days or weeks on a problem and then
	to discover that your colleague next door had already done it years ago.
	Sharing the same objective of solving a tough problem can help to know the skills of
	your friends and colleagues and can give birth to a new and efficient problem solving team.
	<br>
	It is important to point out that this workshop is not an hackaton, which means that
	no one wins anything, apart new friends and a possible publication or project proposal,
	though again, a future publication is not the main goal of the retreat.
	<br>
	In the following you can find some ideas that we collected.
	These are to be considered as catalysts for futher ideas.
	Once a team is formed, you can be free to steer the discussion towards anything you like, or
	stick to the proposed lines.
	You do not need to work out data, rather try to come up with a more solid plan by finding
	relevant literature and discussing the subject.
	<br>
	Some of the proposed lines are speculative, some others are more data or algorithm oriented.
	<b>Please choose one subject and find out who would like to work on that, then team up.
	If large teams form we might split them up, since too large teams are not inclusive enough.
	If you do not like the subject anymore, feel free to change or start a new one.</b>
	We do not want bored people hanging around.
	<br>
	The only outcome we would like to have is a brief account of what happened during the workshop that
	one team member can report the day after.
	It does not need to be results.
	We are very interested in the dynamics happening in the groups and how problems have been solved.
	<br>
	<b> Have fun!</b>

	Environmental Costs of Large-scale Language Models
	(<a href="https://www.csh.ac.at/researcher/max-pellert/" >Max Pellert</a>)
</h2>

Currently, the paradigm of "larger is better" in NLP leads to models with billions of parameters trained on text corpora of many terabytes with specialized computing infrastructure that offers enough resources to handle those models. The energy consumption is considerable (training BERT on GPU is roughly equivalent to a trans-oceanic flight for example and by now there are way larger models). At the same time, investments in renewable energy sources lead to the proliferation of technologies like photovoltaics that can produce more energy than is needed in certain ideal conditions (during sunny summer days for example). Instead of relying only on batteries, we could use some of that excess energy to train language models to store it in the form of information. I imagine the project to lead to the initial sketch of a whitepaper of the potentials and limitations of this idea for the European Union including some projections in the year 2030 or beyond.

<h2>
	When does a scientific article become a general reference in its field?
	(<a href="https://www.csh.ac.at/researcher/jan-korbel/" >Jan Korbel</a>)
</h2>
<b>Motivation:</b> everybody knows papers from their fields that are a general reference
for the field: they have many citations and they are typically cited in the introduction
as a general reference but are not directly related to the paper itself.
In many cases, it can be review-papers, but they are often regular papers
(even not in top journals) that established a new paradigm or new subfield.
I would be interested in an analysis of when a paper becomes such a general reference,
after how long time and how many citations, and how it changes the citation rate afterward.
<br><br>
For this purpose, I can suggest the simplest classification of general reference that one can think
of, i.e., if a reference appears in the introduction of the paper, it is considered as a general
reference, if it appears anywhere else, it is considered as a specific reference.
Indeed, this is a crude division, and having in mind that some journals do not have sections, one can think about more fine-grained classification, but this is good as a first step.
<br><br>
Of course, in general, it is difficult to say whether the reference appears in the introduction or somewhere else since different journals have different formats of their papers and it might be not possible to read off this information. But I remember that Johannes Wachs had an access to either arXiv API or they downloaded the whole arXiv database. The advantage is that most of the papers are there in LaTeX so it is simple to recognize sections etc.
<br><br>
Doing systematic work on this DB is too challenging for the workshop, but maybe some preliminary steps can be done. One possibility is to make a 'case study, i.e., to choose a few famous papers and analyze when they became a 'general reference'. Also, one can see whether my hypothesis is correct: some papers can be 'considered as general reference', but they still appear a lot in the rest of the paper since they contain some technical details that are still of direct use. Or maybe one can just identify sentences with an excessive number of citations as e.g., ... which has found applications in a [1-3], b [4-12], and c [13-30]. Or similar sentences.

<h2>
	When and where did music become complex?
	(<a href="https://www.csh.ac.at/researcher/frank-neffke/" >Frank Neffke</a>)
</h2>

<b>Background</b><br>
I have to admit, I am not a great connoisseur of music (and definitely not a musician). But arriving in Vienna, I guess music is hard to overlook. What strikes me as interesting is that in antiquity, music seems to have been a fairly non-complex activity. It was played by one or at most a few musicians at the same time. In contrast, "modern" classical music combines hundreds of musicians into orchestras that play a variety of instruments guided by a conductor. Interestingly, music theory far precedes this, going probably further back than ancient Greece. Also, I am unaware (although this may be my ignorance) of large orchestras having emerged outside Europe.
<br><br>
<b>Hypothesis</b><br>
Complex music (e.g., music that is orchestrated across a large set of musicians) happened at the same time and in the same geography as progress and increasing complexity in other fields of human endeavor (technology, science, math, etc.). Of course, it would be even more interesting to have a hypothesis for why this is the case (if it is the case), but I'll leave that for the brainstorm.

<br><br>
<b>Approach</b><br>
Can we find databases on music pieces, the year and place in which they were written and the composition of the orchestras they required? A simple starting point is wikipedia, which provides the instrumentation for some music pieces. Another way might be to analyze the complexity of the music itself.

<h2>
	Distilling the truth from news
	(<a href="https://www.csh.ac.at/researcher/vito-d-p-servedio/" >Vito DP Servedio</a>)
</h2>

<b>Motivation:</b><br>
Media present news after filtering and adjusting the content to be published. In doing so, personal ideas, political ideologies and beliefs are injected in the material offered to the public. For this reason, many politicians use to browse multiple newspapers during the day and try to come up with a clean understanding of the facts. They base their ability to distill the truth on their own experience.<br>
<b>Objective:</b><br>
From the many sources of information available online, i.e., newspapers, blog posts, twits, etc., try to determine the real unabridged core facts underlying the news and assign a trust score to the different media sources. A confidence level may be associated to the distilled fact, whereas a confidence level of zero would signify that from the considered sources it is not possible to disentangle the truth.<br>

<h2>
	Cookbook Networks
	(<a href="https://www.csh.ac.at/researcher/tobias-reisch/" >Tobias Reisch</a>)
</h2>
A cookbook is essentially a bipartite network of meals and ingredients. Encoded in this information is which flavors taste good together and that regional cuisines favor certain flavor combinations [1]. At the CSH we are a diverse mix of cultures that have very different cuisines. In this project we aim to use network science to combine the different cooking styles of the cultures represented at the CSH. <br>
Start by mapping out the existing space of recipes and then build a program that invents new recipes based on the favourite foods of CSH members. Perhaps we find that some Pecorino Romano is the only ingredient that has been missing for the perfect Chorescht, Samosas work perfectly with Apfelstrudel-filling or Sauerkraut improves greatly with a pinch of Szechuan pepper.<br>
A data set of machine readable recipes can be found here [2], but feel free to search for additional data sources. Probably network-science based ideas make the most sense, but bonus points are awarded for the project with the most machine learning!<br>

	Moneyballing
	(<a href="https://www.csh.ac.at/researcher/tobias-reisch/" >Tobias Reisch</a>)
</h2>
Sports betting is a huge industry that makes billions of Euros every year [1]. There is a lot of data available on sports and sports betting [1]. However, the betting market has been shown to still contain inefficiencies that can be exploited [2-4]. This challenge asks you to develop an algorithm yourself that consistently outperforms bookmakers and consistently generate revenue. Datasets of scores and betting odds are openly available [6-8]; of course it is strongly encouraged to leverage any other data sources you can find.<br>

	Develop the <i>CSH Educational Toolkit</i>
	(<a href="https://www.csh.ac.at/researcher/tobias-reisch/" >Tobias Reisch</a>)
</h2>
Public outreach is an important part of the mission of a scientific institution like the CSH. We have to convince the public that their tax-money is spent in a meaningful way. Furthermore, outreach targeted at a young audience can motivate more students to pick complexity science related career paths. It would be useful to have a “CSH Educational Toolkit” that teaches complexity science to non-scientists, which can be used when students visit the Hub or there is an event like “Lange Nacht der Forschung” (en: “Long night of science”).<br>
The key to successful science communication is to engage the visitors: interactivity, visualization and gamification [1]. There are good materials online [2, 3], but we need to collect them and make them available at the CSH. The toolbox could include interactive (online) visualizations, small puzzles participants are challenged to solve or group-games that demonstrate physical (or other) principles. <br>

	Do pretty stuff
	(<a href="https://www.csh.ac.at/researcher/tobias-reisch/" >Tobias Reisch</a>)
</h2>
Art is a unique cultural phenomenon that has evolved in most (all?) cultures around the world. It can be fulfilling and inspiring to create pieces of art themselves. Not surprising, many scientists have taken it upon themselves to create and discuss art [1, 2]. It remains an open question whether this art is actually good. Therefore, I propose an experiment to decide if artworks created by scientists have artistic value: The participants of this group are asked to create artistic expressions of their research. They will then create a small exhibition on day 2 and the audience will be asked to judge the artistic quality and value of the artwork. We do not want to limit the creativity of the researchers to a certain technique; drawings [3], poems [4], songs [5] or contemporary dance [6] are all warmly welcome. Some materials will be provided, however, if the researchers feel more comfortable with the computer, here are some suggestions [7, 8]. <br>

	Peer review and science communication on Twitter
	(<a href="https://www.csh.ac.at/researcher/jan-hurt/" >Jan Hurt</a>)
</h2>

<b>Motivation:</b><br>
In the last few years, for a lot of scientists, Twitter did become an irreplaceable element of the scientific process. Especially Covid related research has to take place at such a pace that a lot of scientific discussion, public communication and one might even argue “informal peer review” [1] takes place on this platform. Whilst other parts of the scientific process, i.e. papers and their citations, have been studied to a large extent, the usage of Twitter by the scientific community, is a quite new development, and has therefore not really been investigated so far. [Maybe I am wrong, but i have not found anything on Google Scholar]
<br><br>
<b>Objective:</b><br>
Define key properties of a “scientific discussion” (as in, “discussion among scientists”) on Twitter, and brainstorm how such a dataset could be created.
Formulate a well defined research question.

	To open or to close the windows: sensor assisted, carbon free air-conditioning at the hub
	(<a href="https://www.csh.ac.at/researcher/jan-hurt/" >Jan Hurt</a>)
</h2>

<b>Motivation:</b><br>
As we all know, the Hub can become quite hot during the summer heatwaves. Since the “Denkmalschutz” basically prohibits the installation of an air-conditioner, one of the only tools left to lower the temperature inside of our offices is the closing and opening of the windows. As it usually gets colder during the night, and heats up during the day, the usual approach is, to open the windows in the morning, close them around 11:00 and open them again in the evening, once it gets cooler outside. However, finding the optimum times at which the windows have to be opened/closed is not trivial, as there are a lot of factors to consider. Those factors include: inside/outside temperature/wet-bulb temperature, inside/outside humidity and (possible) air draft.
<br><br>
<b>Objectives:</b><br>
<ul>
	<li>
		Define an experimental setup (probably an arduino/raspberry pi with some sensors attached) to answer this question, and get some sponsoring (@Philipp) to install it next summer.
	</li>
	<li>
		Find a good utility which reflects the heat perception.

	Meritocracy in winning best poster awards or the merit of knowing many people at a conference
	(<a href="https://www.csh.ac.at/researcher/christian-diem/" >Christian Diem</a>)
</h2>

<b>Research question:</b><br>
Is there are a home bias or session bias in best poster / presentation award on conferences?<br><br>
<b>Description:</b><br>
Description: Anecdotal evidence suggests that  – at least on smaller conferences  – sometimes the best poster / presentation awards are won by people affiliated with the local organizing institutions. Is it really the case that this happens more than chance permits? Lets find out whats the null model, i.e. expecting winning probability for each institutions, check for some conferences where the information is known and see if the initial presumption is verified. If there seems to be some evidence lets discuss how to systematically make the comparison for a set of conferences over several year.<br><br>

<b>Additional testing hypothesis:</b><br>
Does the Session play a role? (first session Monday morning, vs  session directly before the best keynote speaker, … ). Can we think of additional hypothesis to test?

	<i>Mafia</i> Tabletop game Network analysis
	(<a href="https://www.csh.ac.at/researcher/sina-sajjadi/" >Sina Sajjadi</a>)
</h2>
<b>Introduction:</b><br>
"Mafia" is a popular party game where an informed united minority (Mafia) tries to deceive an uninformed majority (Civilians.)<br>
Game rules:<br>
Initially roles (Mafia - Civilian) are assigned randomly via secret cards.
The game is made up of several rounds, each consisting of two phases, night and day.
1. Night: The Mafia (who know their teammates) secretly decide to murder an individual.
2. Day: All the living players collectively vote to execute an individual.
[Dead individuals will be barred from any further engagement with the game. but do not lose the game.]
<br>Game Goal:<br>
<ul>
	<li>if #(Living Civilians) == #(living Mafia): Mafia wins.</li>
	<li>elif #(living Mafia) == 0: Civilians win.</li>
	<li>else: continue the game for another round.</li>
</ul>
For more information on the game, see:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)"> Mafia_(party_game)</a>
<br><br>
<b>Project description:</b><br>
Multiple types of paired interactions occur during the game, such as "accusation", "voting for", "defending" or possibly "murder attempt". Documenting these interactions will lead to several directed networks. We analyze the networks to:
<ol>
<li> Find possible patterns leading to the deduction of players' secret roles, e.g., find out who is Mafia based on their connectivity patterns.</li>
<li> Finding possible biases with regards to the players' real life gender, age, nationality, etc.</li>
</ol>
We will play the game for several turns and analyze the results!

Reviewing papers is time-consuming, but usually not rewarded, and in general seen as one of the lesser attractive parts of scientific work. This leads to sloppy reviews, which negatively affects all of science.
<br><br>
How can we improve the review process? Or maybe even come up with a better way to review and judge scientific work? How to incentivize high quality reviews? How can we utilize new technologies to accomplish this (e.g. using gamification or blockchain based solutions for keeping record / incentive)?
